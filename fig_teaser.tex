	\caption[Dynamic texture synthesis]{Dynamic texture synthesis. (left) Given an input dynamic texture as the target, the two-stream model synthesizes a novel dynamic texture that preserves the target's appearance and dynamics characteristics. (right) The two-stream approach enables synthesis that combines the texture appearance from one target with the dynamics from another, resulting in a composition of the two.}
