\caption[Qualitative comparison with Funke \etal's \cite{funke2017} model]{Qualitative comparison with Funke \etal's \cite{funke2017} model on one of the sequences used in their work. Note that this sequence does not follow the thesis' assumption of a dynamic texture\highlight{, in the sense that the appearance and/or dynamics are not spatiotemporally homogeneous}.
(top row) Target sequence.
(middle row)
Dynamic texture synthesis when using Funke \etal's model. The model fails to capture the up-right motion of the leaves.
(bottom row)
Dynamic texture synthesis when using the proposed two-stream model. The up-right motion of the leaves is captured. Results are best viewed in video.
