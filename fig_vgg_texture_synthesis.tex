	\caption[Static texture synthesis with a convolutional network]{Gatys \etal's \cite{gatys2015} approach to static texture synthesis with the VGG-19 \cite{simonyan2014very} convolutional network. Only the first layer of VGG-19 is shown. (1) An initial forward pass is
performed with the target texture. Its Gram matrices
across various layers are computed and saved. (2) The total L2 loss between the synthesized texture's Gram matrices and the target's is computed. (3) The loss is optimized with respect to the synthesized texture (with the weights of VGG-19 fixed), updating it to appear perceptually similar to the target.}
