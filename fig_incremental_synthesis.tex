	Long sequences can be incrementally generated by
separating the sequence into subsequences and optimizing them 
sequentially. The last frame (blue border) of a previously synthesized subsequence
(left) is used to initialize the first frame of the next subsequence (middle)
and is kept fixed throughout optimization. The remaining frames of the 
subsequence (yellow border) are initialized randomly and optimized as per usual.
Finally, the two subsequences are combined to produce a longer
sequence (right).}
