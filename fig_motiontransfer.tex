\caption[Dynamics style transfer]{Dynamics style transfer.
(top row) 
Appearance of still water was
used with the dynamics of a different water dynamic texture
(\path{water_4}).
(second row) 
The appearance of a painting of fire was used
with the dynamics of a real fire (\path{fireplace_1}).
(third row) 
The appearance of a painting of ocean water was used
with the dynamics of a water dynamic texture (\path{water_4}).
(bottom row) 
The appearance of a painting of a waterfall was used
with the dynamics of a waterfall dynamic texture (\path{waterfall}).
Animated results and additional examples are available in
the supplemental material.}
